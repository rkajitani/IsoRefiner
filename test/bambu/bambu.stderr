Warning message:
package ‘matrixStats’ was built under R version 4.3.3 
If you are running bambu multiple times we recommend processing your annotation file first with annotations = prepareAnnotations(gtf.file)
WARNING - If you change the number of cores (ncore) between Bambu runs and there is no progress please restart your R session to resolve the issue that originates from the XGboost package.
--- Start generating read class files ---
Detected 1 warnings across the samples during read class construction. Access warnings with metadata(bambuOutput)$warnings
--- Start extending annotations ---
WARNING - Less than 50 TRUE or FALSE read classes for NDR precision stabilization.
NDR will be approximated as: (1 - Transcript Model Prediction Score)
Using a novel discovery rate (NDR) of: 0.333
--- Start isoform quantification ---
--- Finished running Bambu ---
Warning messages:
1: In findHighConfidenceJunctions(junctions = uniqueJunctions, junctionModel = junctionModel,  :
  no junction correction as no high confidence reference junctions found
2: There was 1 warning in `summarise()`.
ℹ In argument: `intersectWidth = max(intersectWidth)`.
Caused by warning in `max()`:
! no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf 
3: Returning more (or less) than 1 row per `summarise()` group was deprecated in
dplyr 1.1.0.
ℹ Please use `reframe()` instead.
ℹ When switching from `summarise()` to `reframe()`, remember that `reframe()`
  always returns an ungrouped data frame and adjust accordingly.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the bambu package.
  Please report the issue to the authors.
